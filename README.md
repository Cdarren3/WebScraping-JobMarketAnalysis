## Limitations

Pre-defined list of commonly required skills could be biased
* Findings on the most common required skills might be biased
  * As skills list is pre-defined
* Increase representation of the analysis by doing a comparison with competitors
  
* Get more insights into the hiring trend by doing a comparison with previous period (e.g. last month/ last year)

* Quite many job postings are posted by headhunt companies, which may lead to an inaccurate conclusion that HR is one of the top industries that is hiring DS jobs
